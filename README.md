Gameplay:

Each player starts with a score of 0.
Players take turns rolling dice to accumulate points.
Rolling a 1 resets the current turn's score to 0, and the turn passes to the other player.
Players can "HOLD" to add their current turn's score to their total score and end their turn.
The game ends when a player reaches a score of 100 points.
Controls:

NEW GAME: Resets the game.
